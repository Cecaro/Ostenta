# Ostenta

Still wondering how to host this website; local hosting is free and sounds cool to do. I'll keep this ReadMe updated to let you guys know. Otherwise we are using compass and ToffleJS to make everything work!

## Sassy

This project uses sass instead of simple css. Why? Well, why not.
To make it work on your machine, follow these steps:
- Make sure to have Ruby installed,
- Install compass `gem install compass`
- Install css_parser `gem install css_parser`

## ToffleJS

This is @nikkorn templating engine! It will be used, partly because it's needed if we want to use templates, but also to showcase what the engine can do!
