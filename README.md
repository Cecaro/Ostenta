## Sassy

This project uses sass instead of simple css. Why? Well, why not.
To make it work on your machine, follow these steps:
- Make sure to have Ruby installed,
- Install compass `gem install compass`
- Install css_parser `gem install css_parser`
- (might not be needed) `gem install bootstrap-sass`
